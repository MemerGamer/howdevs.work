import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

We're developers who write about the stuff nobody else talks about: the 3am debugging sessions, the architecture decisions that seemed brilliant until they weren't, and the messy human reality of building software.

No corporate buzzwords, no "thought leadership," no clickbait. Just honest stories from people who've shipped code, led teams, and learned some hard lessons along the way.

## What you'll find here

<CardGrid stagger>

    The outages that taught us humility, the bugs that made us question
    everything, and the victories that reminded us why we do this.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tools that actually work" icon="add-document">
    Real reviews of the stuff we use daily—build tools, monitoring, CI/CD
    setups—based on actual battle scars.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team dynamics, honestly" icon="document">
    How we handle code reviews, async work, technical debt, and all the human
    stuff that makes or breaks engineering teams.
